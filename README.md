# Customer Behavior Analysis using Transactional Data

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal is to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and association analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of transactional data obtained from [source](link_to_data_source). It includes information such as transaction IDs, product descriptions, quantities, prices, etc.

## File Descriptions
- `custbehaviour.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- `Hackathon_Working_Data.csv`: CSV file containing the transactional data used for analysis.

## Libraries Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For K-means clustering.
- mlxtend: For association analysis using the Apriori algorithm.

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Descriptive Statistics
    - Data Visualization
3. Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
4. Association Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm
5. Insights and Recommendations

## How to Run
To run the analysis notebook:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer-behavior-analysis`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook custbehaviour.ipynb`
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to run the analysis.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and associations between products. These insights can be used to drive marketing strategies, product recommendations, pricing optimization, and customer retention efforts.
